# Wasteland
A spinoff of the very popular game, Oregon Trail. Written purely in html and css.

## What I learned making this project
During this project I got to learn way more about javascript and using pure html and css to remake the classic game,
Oregon Trail. I also learned about how hard game development really is, more specifically managing the scope of when a 
game is really "finished" because it at points it feels like there is an infinite amount of things that can be added
into the game to make it better.

## Dependencies
